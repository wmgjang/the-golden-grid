The Golden Grid like every other CSS Layout System (framework ) is a closed solution.

Sometimes  you need more options in order to get "outside the grid". You can do it manually writing CSS code or have some nice tool to help you.

Now there is a tool called [Grid System Generator](http://www.gridsystemgenerator.com/) created by [Ewout Kozel](http://www.ekozel.com/) who uses The Golden Grid building logic. You may find this tool helpful.
